# SE 2024 Project: Image Style Generator

## Setup
  Language: Python
  
  ### Packages: 
  As of 2024/4, the default installs of python pip install still work for the project. 
  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```
  ```
  pip install PyQt5
  ```
  ```
  pip install torch
  ```
  ```
  pip install torchvision
  ```
  If you want to check out ImageProcessingExtensions.py you will have to install OpenCV as well. 

## Demo
  After setting up the environment, you can run the `main.py` file to see a quick demo of the project. In the search bar you can type "Earth" and view the different styles in our demo. Afterwards, you can run the `ImageProcessingExtensions.py` file to see a demo of basic image processing of imagery. 

## Future work: 
TODO: I will probably have to modify the project a bit to better fit our project topic. 

### Current Ideas (Tentative)
(Feel free to modify/add to the project if you have any other ideas!)

Maybe we can:
- Allow user to upload content image
- Allow user to search for style image
- Generate and display an image that conbines the content of the content image and the style of the style image.
